<h2>Nationality & culture</h2>
  <p>Australian with an Italian and Austrian heritage.  </p>
  
<h2>Previous Studies</h2>
  <p>Retail Cert III<p>
<p>Business Administration cert III & IV<p>
<p>Bachelor of Nutritional Medicine (Endeavour College) – Incomplete
</p>
  
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>I enjoy drawing and art and follow many artists on social media sites. I am currently working mostly on watercolor art which I do specifically for friends and family. I also hope to get more experience at using oil paints though due to the cost and time involved in this art form verses watercolor or acrylic I have not yet undertaken this endeavor.<p>
<p>I also enjoy fictional writing and am hoping to one day produce my own fictional novel. This has been an interest of mine since a very young age and though I never intend to make a living out of writing I find myself thinking of new ideas for my book daily so am regular adding to my notes and draft during my daily commute to and from work.
</p>
  
<h2>What is your interest in IT?</h2>
  <p>My Interest in IT stems from a practical perspective. Whilst I use IT daily and often for recreational activities, I find my fundamental interest is in the development of new technologies to further enhance user experience and to redefine our day to day lives. </p>
  
<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
  <p>At the time I began my studies RMIT was one of the only University to offer an accredited Bachelor of Business in ‘Financial planning’ 100% online through Open University. Now there are quite a few other Universities offering online only courses as this has become a more popular choice of study.</p>
  
<h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
  <p>The fundamental skills to be able to have a successful career in financial planning and also some practical skills to assist me in life. </p>
  
<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
  <p>My ideal Job is working as a financial planner/counsellor for those in financial hardship within the Australian Defence Force and from remote rural areas. I have worked on army bases for a large part of my career and see a need for further financial education within the sector. Much the same, I feel that individuals within remote localities do not have access to as much financial support systems as they should. Ideally I see myself assisting these individuals in rebuilding their finances and assisting them in planning for a future with financial security. </p>
  
<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
   <p>The three tests I have completed are the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), VARK test and an Online Creativity Test. </p>
   
   <a href= "https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-friends"</a>
   
<h3> What do the results of these tests mean for you?<h3>
   <h2> </h2>
  <p>They mean that I am generally a free thinker who learns by doing. I tend to enjoy a challenge and learning new things. </p>
<h3> How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?<h3>
    <h2> </h2>
   <p>C I would need to be actively involved in teamwork to learn. I would also struggle to manage strong personalities as I may be too eager to please and meet expectations. </p>
<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?<h3>
    <h2> </h2>
   <p> I would need to be very communicative with my team and ensure that I do not get overly absorbed by new and exciting ideas that leave us out of depth. </p>


<h1>Project Idea</h1>
  <p>My project idea would be a phone/tablet app which integrates the role of a financial adviser. Essentially it is an electronic adviser portal where individuals seeking financial advice can connect through he app with qualified adviser and be provided the support that they need remotely.  <p>
 <p>The main services of the app would be to assist in budgeting, investing and lending advice specifically for those seeking finance knowledge delivered in simple terms.  <p>
 <p>Ideally the app would be able to be integrated with the individuals banking services and easily be able to record trends of spending habits and bills to allow the individual and adviser to track them.  <p>
 <p>Other functionalities could include goal trackers for saving and paying off loans, notifications for return on investments or better rate offers on finance and a “call for help” option where an individual is seeking an emergency meeting with their financial advice regarding a major financial decision or crisis.  The adviser should be contactable 24hours a day through a live chat to be able to assist individuals with day to day decisions regarding their finances. There also needs to be a face-to-face video chat option to enable the initial interview where majority of the data collection about the individual’s lifestyle and finances is obtained and for the adviser to provide initial outline of their scope of advice.  <p>
 <p>There are multiple roadblocks when looking at an app with the above capabilities. Some of the major ones include: <p>
 <p>•	Security against fraud and compromise of the system <p>
 <p>•	Privacy of highly sensitive consumer information  <p>
 <p>•	Compliance with the laws governing the finance and banking sector and the scope of advice provided by financial advisers <p>
 <p>•	The capability for the App to be able to have stable functionality across multiple types and brands of devices (i.e. apple vs android) whilst also remaining simple and user friendly  <p>
 <p>•	The capability of the app to effectively integrate specific data from a vast range of information systems used by various banks and credit unions <p>
 <p>•	Ensuring that all advisers contracted to work are fully qualified and completing any necessary training to maintain this status <p>
   
 <p>My motivation around this project stems from the idea of having financial support at your fingertips. This idea is directly driven by my passion for assisting individuals in already in financial hardship or in a position where they are highly vulnerable to becoming so. <p>
 <p>The app would need to be a cloud based technology to allow integration of multiple user’s digital finance platforms and be able to perform highly complex algorithms to track and analyze large amounts of financial data. <p>
 <p>The skills required to generate the app would require multiple programmers and developers with in depth knowledge of coding to create the app. Also some innovative accountants and financial advisers would need to be involved to assist in ensuring the application could perform the functions required to effectively complete the finance aspects required by the users. <p>
 <p> The outcome would be a fully functional app which provide real-time financial advice at the touch of a button. <p>
